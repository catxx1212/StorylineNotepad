# VER 0.6.0
## Changes in this update:

- Added three new themes: Oceanside Nap, Cozy Bed, and Rainy Day.
- Added a new user preference: text alignment.
- Added a "Clear Data" menu.
- The theme menu now jumps to your current active theme when opened.
- Made slight adjustments to the layout.
- Changing the light or dark mode on pages using the toggle now updates the fallback theme. This ensures that when navigating to another page, the theme remains consistent (does not affect the storyline notepad if a theme is already set).
- The loading screen now follows the selected fallback theme.
- Created a tutorial storyline. If you were a user before this update, you can download it from the changelog.
- Fixed a bug with the import buttons.
- Added dates to the changelog.
- Added action previews for the arrow context menu.
- Added scroll priority: when your mouse is over a scrollable storybox, it will scroll that box instead of the entire storyline.
- Made some other small changes, fixes, and optimizations.

### Storyline notepad is a website that allows you to plan or outline your next potential story

### I originally created Storyline Notepad to help (and procrastinate on) with a game's base story. Since then, I have revisited and completely overhauled it with new features and (much) better code and layout.

## Known issues (Found by me, if you find one that is not listed here, please open an issue)
  - Having the same storyline open in two tabs or windows will result in one overwriting the other.
  - Using the browser's back arrow can cause issues with saved data.
    - (This should not be an issue anymore, as the storyline save slot page ensures that access to the storyline page is only possible if an active save reference is present).
  - Storyline Notepad's layout is still not optimized for phone users yet.

### Features that will eventually be in storyline notepad:
- More themes (I try to add at least one new theme per update)
- I COULD ADD THEME RELATED BACKGROUND MUSIC!! (I might, but not a definite yes)
