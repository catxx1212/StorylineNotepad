### Storyline notepad is a website that allows you to plan or outline your next potential story

### I originally created Storyline Notepad to help (and procrastinate on) with a game's base story. Since then, I have revisited and completely overhauled it with new features and (much) better code.

## Known issues (Found by me, if you find one that is not listed here, please open an issue)
  - Having the same storyline open in two tabs or windows will result in one overwriting the other.
  - Using the browser's back arrow can cause issues with saved data.
    - (This should not be an issue anymore, as the storyline save slot page ensures that access to the storyline page is only possible if an active save reference is present).
  - Storyline Notepad's layout is still not optimized for phone users yet.

### Features that will eventually be in storyline notepad:
- More themes (I try to add at least one new theme per update)
- I COULD ADD THEME RELATED BACKGROUND MUSIC!! (I might, but not a definite yes)
